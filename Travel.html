    Indian Railways, becoming one of the<br> largest networks in the world. IR operates both long distance and
    suburban rail systems on a multi-gauge network of broad, metre and narrow gauges. It also owns locomotive<br> and coach production

<li><h1>FLIGHT</h1></li>
<p><h3>Indian, formerly Indian Airlines (Indian Airlines Limited from 1993 and Indian Airlines Corporation from 1953 to 1993) was a major Indian airline based in Delhi and focused <br>primarily on domestic routes, along with several international services to neighbouring countries in Asia. It was state-owned, and was administered by the Ministry of Civil<br> Aviation. It was one of the two flag carriers of India, the other being Air India. The airline officially merged into Air India on 27 February 2011.

On 7 December 2005, the airline <br>was rebranded as Indian for advertising purposes as a part of a program to revamp its image in preparation for an initial public offering (IPO). The airline operated closely with <br>Air India, India's national carrier. Alliance Air, a fully owned subsidiary of Indian, was renamed Air India Regional.</h3>

<li><h1>BUS</h1></li>
<p><h3>Buses take up over 90% of public transport in Indian cities, and serve as a cheap and convenient mode of transport for all classes of society. Services are mostly run by state<br> government owned transport corporations. However, after the economic liberalization, all those government state transport corporations have introduced various facilities like<br> low-floor buses for the disabled and air-conditioned buses to attract private car owners to help decongest roads. Mumbai introduced air conditioned buses in 1998.<br>Bangalore city was the first city in India to introduce Volvo B7RLE intra-city buses in India in January 2005 .</h3></p>
